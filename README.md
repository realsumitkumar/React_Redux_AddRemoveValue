Redux Implementation
The Redux implementation in this app follows the standard structure with actions, reducers, and the store.

Actions: The depositMoney and withdrawMoney action creators in src/state/index.js dispatch the corresponding actions with the amount parameter as the payload.

Reducers: The amountReducer in src/reducers.js handles the state updates based on the dispatched actions.

Store: The Redux store is created in src/store.js and combines the reducers using combineReducers from the redux library.

React Components: The Shop component in src/Shop.js uses useSelector to access the amount state from the Redux store and useDispatch to dispatch the actions using the withdrawMoney and depositMoney functions.

Acknowledgments
This app is a simple example of using Redux in a React application. It can serve as a starting point for more complex Redux implementations.
